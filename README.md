# Dice-Roll-Simulation
A dice roll simulation is a tool that emulates the act of rolling dice. It is commonly used in various games, simulations, and statistical experiments where the outcome of rolling dice needs to be replicated.
In dice roll simulation, a random number generator is employed to mimic the randomness of a physical dice roll. The most common type of dice used in simulations is the six-sided die, which has numbers 1 to 6 on its faces.
